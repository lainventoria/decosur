Cooperative


Technicians, machinists, and administrative workers are part of the cooperative DECOSUR, and they all work under the principle that commitment and responsibility constitute the foundation of the challenging activity they have been performing for many years. Together they satisfy the most demanding requirements in terms of operations´ efficiency and quality, and strive to continuously improve the processes developed to render the cooperative services. 
Most of the cooperative current members worked for the firm Victorio De Bernardi S.A. [a corporation] and they put the valuable experience gained there into work in the cooperative. However, the chief strength of our organization lies in the fact that the workers strongly committed themselves when they decided to take control of the bankrupt corporation themselves and turned it into a cooperative (that is to say, when they “recovered” the company). Thus, the main values of the cooperative are the responsibility, creativity, willingness to work, and participation of each worker-owner.
Responsibility, creativity, Willingness to work and participation of each worker-owner





The cooperative is governed by its Estatuto Social [the cooperative´s bylaw] and its Reglamento Interno [the cooperative´s rules and regulations] approved by INAES [an Argentine institute in charge of promoting the creation of cooperatives] in accordance with the Ley Nacional de Cooperativas [Argentine act on cooperatives] and other regulations enacted by INAES. All the aforementioned rules have been enforced to organize the activities developed by the cooperative while guaranteeing that these activities are carried out in accordance with safety regulations as well as regulations to preserve the environment.

History
Cooperative Management = service quality and safety guaranty







The origins of the company go back to 1893, when Victorio De Bernardi (VDB) settled down in our country and started transporting asphalt and fuels to make a living.  Afterwards he sets up a family business which in the 1960´s starts building the storage plant in Dock Sud. 
After the corporation set up by Victorio went bankrupt in September 2001, the workers started a process to take control of the corporation themselves and to turn it into a cooperative which they called Cooperativa de Trabajo Obreros VDB [VDB worker cooperative]. The cooperative was afterwards renamed DECOSUR. It was a tough period but the cooperative members worked hard and tenaciously, facing the future with faith and hope. Thus, they were able to fix the plant and to overcome the crisis which had brought about the bankruptcy of the previous company. 
On May 22, 2002, the cooperative is officially recognized and it starts working in September 2003, after having obtained all the permits and licenses to operate. These permits and licenses guarantee the protection of the environment and the safety of the cooperative´s procedures.  
Since then, the cooperative has operated without stop and has gained the confidence of its clients, suppliers, auditors, and the government bodies involved. The cooperative has also deepened the cooperative values and has improved in order to perform a more efficient and responsible service.
In January 2012, the cooperative acquired a plant from the company SOLVAY INDUPA, since this petrochemical company had decided to cease its activities in Dock Sud. The cooperative reconditioned the plant to use it exclusively to provide the electric system with gas oil. This last event represented an important goal in the history of this worker-recovered company.

Agreement with ACUMAR






The worker cooperative Decosur reached an agreement with the Autoridad de Cuenca Matanza Riachuelo (ACUMAR) [governmental authority in charge of the sanitation of the river Matanza-Riachuelo] to install a station to monitor air pollutants in the Decosur plant located in the area of the port of Dock Sud. Thus, ACUMAR will be able to monitor the ambient air quality in an industrial area that is being restructured



Provision to the power station of Dock Sud 








The power station of Dock Sud is one of the most important power plants in the interconnected national system and it is highly efficient at generating combined-cycle electric power (more than 5000 Gw/h).
<See More>

The combined-cycle uses two gas turbines and a steam turbine, and represents one of the newest cycles in the country.
The worker cooperative Decosur is connected to the power station through a pipe system that supplies the station with liquid fuel as an alternative to the lack of gas, mainly in winter months in which the liquid fuel provision reaches 2000 m3/day; thus, the continuous electric power supply is guaranteed, an efficient service is rendered, and the environment is protected.

DECOSUR complies with the strictest rules and regulations of hygiene, safety and environmental protection, and to do so, it analyzes the specific and potential risks of its activities; tests its equipment and checks its premises regularly; and controls that safety procedures are being followed in case of an emergency by often simulating possible accidents. 
The cooperative is included in the Plan Nacional de Contingencias (PLANACON) [Argentine contingency plan] and has adopted the International Ship and Port Facility Security Code (ISPS Code). 
The quality policy is enhanced by each cooperative worker-owner commitment and their high levels of efficiency and responsibility to carry out the cooperative activities. The cooperative has also improved its actions to increase the quality of its services by qualifying its workers, assessing the workers´ performance, and constantly improving its processes. 

                                                   Environmental management
In order to complement the environmental management policies of the cooperative, Decosur has implemented an industrial rationalization program to preserve the natural resources; the program has been agreed upon with the Autoridad de Cuenca Matanza Riachuelo (ACUMAR) [governmental authority in charge of the sanitation of the river Matanza-Riachuelo] and it is known as Programa de Reconversión Industrial (PRI).
In accordance with the program, the cooperative has monitored and controlled its activities, has taken precautionary measures, and has installed a new API decantation pool for rainwater drainage.

Efficiency and commitment in the performance of each task
Since the cooperative started to operate, it has had a client-oriented policy to make sure that clients’ requirements are fully satisfied, and it has improved its efficiency and commitment to every task it performs. 
In the last years, the main activity of the cooperative has been related to hydrocarbons like gas oil, fuel oil and gasoline, and the cooperative has provided services in order to:
Facilitate liquid fuel storage to guarantee that industries will be able to work in case of a lack of fuel provision from other sources. 
Provide the logistics necessary for hydrocarbon commercialization.
Act as a port terminal in export and import operations.
Supply power plants with liquid fuel.
DUE TO THIS KIND OF SERVICES, THE COOPERATIVE HANDLES A CLIENT PORTFOLIO THAT INCLUDES SOME OF THE MAIN COMPANIES IN THE POWER SECTOR. 






PROVISION TO THE POWER SYSTEM
In the last years, as a consequence of the sustained growth of the economic activity, the consumption of electric power has significantly risen, and more than 60 % of the electric power is produced in power plants run by fuels from mineral origin.
The activities carried out by cooperative Decosur contribute to supply these power plants distributed along the whole country with fuel. While performing its activities Decosur has achieved an efficiency level appreciated by the bodies in charge of the electric power supply, and has also been awarded distinctions by the Secretaría de Energía de la Nación [Argentine Department of Energy].
We are proud of this responsibility not only because it made the cooperative growing in the last years until it doubled the number of workers and the premises´ capacity, but also, and more important, because it allows the cooperative to contribute to the country´s development.
